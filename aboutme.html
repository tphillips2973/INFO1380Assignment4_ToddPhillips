        <h1 class="display-3">About Me!</h1>
        <p class="lead">Throughout my entire life, I have always enjoyed creating things on the computer. 
		Whether that be art, games, programs, songs, I enjoyed spending my time working on projects 
		involving the usage of a computer. Although when I found programming, I loved the aspect of 
		finding the best ways to create the programs I want to make. While this was never fully 
		practiced mind you when I was younger, I still enjoyed the challenge. I made sure I strived to
		create games during my high school life that no one else in the course would dare try. 
		The best example of this fact was the Fully Three-Dimentional Spaceship shooter based 
		on the popular francise known as Star Wars. This game was made using Unreal Engine 4.13 and 
		had multiple levels, with different themed areas, adjustable camera, enemy AI tracking, etc.
		I have also made many other projects, just not as exciting as a Star Wars game. You can find
		examples of the projects i've worked on in the "Game Development" page referred on the
		 main page of this website.</p>
